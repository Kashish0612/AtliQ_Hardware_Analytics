<h1>Project objective- </h1>
AtliQ Hardware, a top hardware company specializing in PCs, Printers, Mouse, and Computers worldwide, needs to boost sales and improve net gross margins and Profits.
The Sales Director understands that merely gathering Excel files from various regional managers is insufficient due to the volume and potential lack of clear insights. Therefore, the objective is to leverage a Data Analyst to extract valuable insights and improve decision-making.
